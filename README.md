# Feedseer

Feedseer is an instance of Mastodon that gives users more control over their feeds.

This is achieved using `qualifiers` and `actions`. `Qualifiers` provide a way to analyze the content of a toot and take action based on that. Based on a qualifier's output, `actions` can be configured to either hide a toot or move it to a folder. Users can create their own qualifiers to analyze different types of toots or provide interesting insights on a toot's content.

> **Feedseer is in Private Alpha. Things will break sometimes and your data may be lost. Our sincere apologies in advance.**

## How to use Feedseer

- Navigate to [Qualifier Store](https://feedseer.com/settings/all_qualifiers).
- Click on a qualifier `name` to see a qualifier's details.
- Read the qualifier `description` to understand the type of analysis performed on a toot.
- Qualifier `endpoint` is where a qualifier is hosted. See the `How to create qualifiers` section below to understand how qualifiers access your toots. Qualifiers cannot access your profile information.
- Add a qualifier to your profile by clicking the `Install` button.
- Click the `Add filter` button to set up an action based on a qualifier's response. The response can be `true` or `false` based on whether or not a toot is related to what the qualifier was looking for.
  - Select a filter condition based on the qualifier's response.
  - Select the action to be taken on a toot that qualifies:
    - Set the action to `Skip Inbox` to remove it from your timelines.
    - Select `Move to folder` and provide a folder name, to move the toot to a folder.
- `Save` the qualifier.
- You can update your qualifier's configuration [here](https://feedseer.com/settings/installed_qualifiers).

> Please write a review for the qualifiers you use so that others can benefit from it. Also, mention the version of qualifier you are reviewing.

## How to create qualifiers

- Navigate to this [page](https://feedseer.com/settings/your_qualifiers).
- Click on `Add qualifier` button.
- Provide a good `name` and `description` for your qualifier.
   - `Description` should include the kind of content a qualifier analyzes and the corresponding response (`true` or `false`) it returns.
- `Endpoint` is the HTTPS URL that will be called with a toot's content.
  - Request will have a `content-type: application/json` header.
  - Request body format will be:
```
{
  "text": "Hello seers!"
}
```
  - Response body format (`content-type: application/json`) should be:

```
{
  "result": true or false (Boolean)
}
```
- `HTTP Headers` will be set on the request sent to your endpoint. It can be used to set authentication headers.
- `Version` can be used to indicate improvements to your qualifier. This helps users review a specific version of a qualifier.
- Select a `category` for the qualifier from the provided list.
- `Save` your qualifier.

> A qualifier will be called only once per toot.

## Roadmap

- Provide more qualifiers out-of-the-box.
- Media toots with qualifiers.
- Granular controls over enabling qualifiers.

Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on ActivityPub. Follow friends and discover new ones. Publish anything you want: links, pictures, text, video. All servers of Mastodon are interoperable as a federated network, i.e. users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one. This includes non-Mastodon software that also implements ActivityPub!

## Features

<img src="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/elephant.svg" align="right" width="30%" />

**No vendor lock-in: Fully interoperable with any conforming platform**

It doesn't have to be Mastodon, whatever implements ActivityPub is part of the social network! [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/why-activitypub-is-the-future/)

**Real-time, chronological timeline updates**

See the updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI via WebSockets. There's a firehose view as well!

**Media attachments like images and short videos**

Upload and view images and WebM/MP4 videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated like GIFs; normal videos are looped - like vines!

**Safety and moderation tools**

Private posts, locked accounts, phrase filtering, muting, blocking and all sorts of other features, along with a reporting and moderation system. [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/)

**OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API**

Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider so 3rd party apps can use the REST and Streaming APIs, resulting in a rich app ecosystem with a lot of choice!

## Deployment

**Tech stack:**

- **Ruby on Rails** powers the REST API and other web pages
- **React.js** and Redux are used for the dynamic parts of the interface
- **Node.js** powers the streaming API

**Requirements:**

- **PostgreSQL** 9.5+
- **Redis**
- **Ruby** 2.4+
- **Node.js** 8+

The repository includes deployment configurations for **Docker and docker-compose**, but also a few specific platforms like **Heroku**, **Scalingo**, and **Nanobox**. The [**stand-alone** installation guide](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/administration/installation/) is available in the documentation.

A **Vagrant** configuration is included for development purposes.
